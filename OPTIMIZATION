Somehow avoid havoc'ing modded values for which a function will never 
look up the value (during the intra-proc symbolic execution)


Stripped down Cil objects:
--------------------------
Strip 3 bools from varinfo (vinline, vreferenced, vaddrof), maybe vstorage also

Strip 1 pointer from type (attributes?)

Strip 1 bool from typeinfo (treferenced)

Strip 1 bool, 1 pointer from enuminfo (ereferenced, eattr)

Strip 2 bools, 1 pointer from compinfo (cdefined, creferenced, cattr?), 
    maybe ckey?

Strip 1 pointer from fieldinfo (fattr?)

Or just load from files, the varinfos based the IDs / cache them?




Stripped down Mapsets
---------------------

Use something that doesn't take something like 20 bytes per node?


Pointer arith
-------------
If an integer is used for pointer arith, handle loops more gracefully (like
array indices) if possible

see: __zzip_parse_root_directory (freshclam_comb.c)
