Building from source 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 1. If you use Windows, you must first install cygwin. (Not tested)

 2. You must install OCaml version 3.08 or higher (see instructions at
    http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml).

 3. Download and unpack the distribution. 

 4. Build the included version of CIL. This should be a "configure" + 
    a "make", but see their INSTALL file. Note: if you get a compilation
    error "File "obj/x86_LINUX/feature_config.ml", line 4, ...",
    edit the obj/x86_LINUX/feature_config.ml file and remove the "-ne" junk.

 5. Run make in the base RELAY directory

 6. Edit the values of the "*ROOT" environment variables in the scripts 
    (scripts/intercept.sh, scripts/dumpcalls.sh) to be the same as 
    the RELAY dir

 7. Optional: go to the racetests directory and run "make renew_small",
    then run "make" to test. The first command preprocesses the tests,
    and the second runs relay. After running the tests, the "diff_out" file
    should show no differences.

 8. Optional: the web UI for browsing warnings requires installation
    of the Django web framework and a database backend
